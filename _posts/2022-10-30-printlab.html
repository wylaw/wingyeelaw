        <h4>PROJECT SUMMARY</h4>
        <p>The Print Lab at the Hive is a maker space that offers screen printing as co-curricular programming to students and community members. This space is a learning space for beginners and a maker space that encourages student use for personal projects. One of the challenges after returning from quarantine was reactivating the space for student use that was engaging and informative, but did not overwhelm the student proctors who helped run the space. I led a team of student proctors to reimagine how we teach screen printing at the Hive. We reimplemented and edited the Print Lab ID as a physical guide to keep track of the screen printing skills users have mastered. We altered the existing event offerings, Skill Shares and Proctor Hours, to ease the stress on student proctors and added 2 new event offerings, Club/Group Print Sessions and Open Hours, to accommodate more users in the space. Users of the Print Lab can now work through the offerings to learn different screen printing skills laid out on the Print Lab ID and eventually be able to use the space without requiring supervision from a student proctor or myself.</p>

<p>The Print Lab ID acts as a physical guide for users to keep track of how much of the screen printing process they have learned and aims to increase repeated use of the space. Once a user can show that they can complete all the steps detailed on the Print Lab ID, they are approved to use the Print Lab by themselves. This allows more time for the student proctors and myself to help newer users of the space. These IDs are given to anyone who wants to be a repeated user of the space and can be started at Skill Shares or Proctor Hours. </p>

<p>The skills listed on the Print Lab ID can be categorized into 5 basic steps of screen printing shown below:</p>

<p>To learn the skills outlined on the Print Lab ID and work on personal projects, students can attend 4 different kinds of offerings. We introduced 2 new offerings, Club/Group Print Sessions and Open Hours, and we edited what skills would be covered at the Skill Shares and Proctor Hours to reduce the stress on student proctors during their workshops and events. The overview breakdowns for each offering including basic description, target user, skills focus, and estimated number of users per semester are detailed below.

                <h5>Description:</h5>
                <p>Skill Shares occur biweekly as 2 hour workshops taught by student proctors. Attendees get into pairs to print designs created by Hive staff members to focus on teaching the immediate process of screen printing, with less focus on the prepatory work (coating screens and creating designs) for screen printing. Users may begin to fill out their Print Lab IDs at these events.</p>

                <h5>Description:</h5>
                <p>Open Hours are by appointment sessions where users who have completed their Print Lab IDs may use the space without proctor supervision and give more time to repeated users of the Print Lab to complete their own projects. The hours offered are less restricted than other offerings and are open for sign up whenever there is not another Print Lab event happening. These sessions allow for longer term engagement from users of the Print Lab and remove some of the stress on student proctors to accommodate more people during Skill Shares or Proctor Hours.</p>

<p>Each of these offerings provide a different type of engagment and teach different skills to the users so they can get the most out of their Print Lab experience. Additionally, each offering flows into another so that users can track how to improve their skills in screen printing.</p>
