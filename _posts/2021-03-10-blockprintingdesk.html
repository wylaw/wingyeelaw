    This design was inspired by my lack of space in my room to have both a desk and a block printing set up. Here I wanted to combine the two to create a more space saving desk/studio set up. This is not meant to replace a studio setting, but as a way for me to support a hybrid of a traditional workspace with my block printing practice.

    .container-1 {
        display:flex;

    .container-1 div{
        border: 1px #fff solid;

    .box-1 {
        flex: 3;
        order: 1;
        padding-right: 8px;
    }
    .box-2 {
        flex: 2;
        order: 2;
        padding-left: 8px;
    }

        <p><br><br><br>This design has side compartments that can hold block printing tools such as cutters, brayers, and barens. The other side compartments can hold ink. It also has a front drawer that can hold supplies such as additional linoleum blocks/other carving mediums and paper for printing. On top of the front of the right side compartment is a slot that holds an acrylic sheet for ink rolling. It can slide in and out for easy cleaning. These side compartments can be covered by rotating desk pieces. When closed, the surface of the desk is enlarged. When opened, the desk transforms into a printing studio and the side panels can be used as additional drying space for prints.</p>
