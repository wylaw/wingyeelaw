            Hello! I'm Wing-Yee, an engineering major at Harvey Mudd College with an interest in creating and fostering accessible ways of learning science and art. As a teaching assistant for engineering and art courses, I have recognized that students come from diverse backgrounds that need to be considered and accommodated in the learning process. I hope to expand my experience into museum work, with particular interest in museum education. In my spare time I love to paint, crochet, bake, print, and dance.
