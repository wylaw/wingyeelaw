            Hello! I'm Wing-Yee, a Post Baccalaureate Associate at the Rick and Susan Sontag Center for Creativity (the Hive) and a recent engineering graduate from Harvey Mudd College with an interest in creating and fostering accessible ways of learning science and art. As a teaching assistant for engineering and art courses, I have recognized that students come from diverse backgrounds that need to be considered and accommodated in the learning process. I hope to combine my technical skills, organization, and management experience from my engineering background with my design and art practice to develop accessible and interactive STEM learning experiences. 
            <br><br>
            In my spare time I love to paint, crochet, bake, print, and dance.
