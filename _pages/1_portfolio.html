                <h2>Wing-Yee Screams Branding</h2>
                <p style="text-decoration:none;">I have always had a love for stuffed animals and a tendancy for starting collections. My desire to have specific stuffed animals that didn't exist drove me to create my own and create a collection of handmade plush. Like with most of my work, I am drawn to character creation and creating plush toys has allowed me to translate the characters I make into 3D space. I create the patterns for these plush and, depending on complexity, machine or hand sew each plush.</p>

                <p style="text-decoration:none;">This is the style guide I created for myself for my business, Wing-Yee Screams. I use these guidelines for creating digital and print assets such as price sheets, signage at vending events, shirt tags, and thank you cards for orders. Wing-Yee Screams is represented by bright primary colors and simple shapes to evoke a sense of play. It is accompanied by a hand drawn logo of a tiger to indicate that my products are hand made and to introduce a personal aspect to my branding.</p>

                <h2>Modular Museum Stand - Exploration</h2>
                <p style="text-decoration:none;">One challenge with travelling exhibits is that the space the exhibit will inhabit changes with each location both in shape and size. This design aims to provide a simple modular solution that allows the exhibit to be adapted to whatever new space it is in. The overall exhibit can expand or reduce in size, as well as change the shape of the stands using angled pieces.</p>
